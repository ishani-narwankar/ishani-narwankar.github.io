# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{site.author.name}}** :wave:,<br>

I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2023 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. While at UT Austin, I was involved with Texas Aerial Robotics (TAR), a research organization working on aerial robotics for use on applications such as autonomous search and rescue. As an intern at autonomous aerial robotics start-up Skydio, I worked with designing and coding test and reliability rigs for quadcopters.

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Robotics at Northwestern University to pursue my interests in novel robotic innovation.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, staying active by playing different sports (I especially enjoy taekwondo and playing ultimate frisbee), trying new recipes, and flying FPV drones.
