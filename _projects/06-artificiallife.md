<!-- ### **Project Brief**
This project happened over the course of my 4th year (two semesters) as an Aerospace Engineering (ASE) undergradate as a part of a Senior Design Team at The University of Texas at Austin. 

This project was funded by the NASA USRC Program and received a grant for $60,000 for the development of the project. It is still continuing for future ASE senior design projects at UT Austin under the Drone Estimation Lab (DEL) which was set up by my team in 2023.

The main goal of this project is to develop a system to ensure collsion avoidance capabilities for drones in GPS-denied environments by applying space-based navigation systems.
