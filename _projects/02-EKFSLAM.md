# EKF SLAM from Scratch for Turtlebot3
<br>

**THIS IS AN ONGOING INDEPENDENT PROJECT. THIS PAGE WILL CONTINUOUSLY BE UPDATED**
<br>

### **Project Brief**
Developing a ROS2 package to implement Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in C++ from scratch. This package is being run on a turtlebot3 and simulated in RVIZ.
