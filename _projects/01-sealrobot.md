## **Introduction**
- *Context*: importance of seal whiskers in biological sensing and how project translates these functions into robotics
- *Objective*: build a system to test and analyze soft robotic whisker sensor arrays' behavior in controlled conditions
<br>
<!-- project flow section here: map building -> digital waypoint -> waypoint navigation -> obstacle avoidance -->

## **Project Overview**
- *Timeline*: 20 week project duration
- *Objective*: Build a system to test and analyze soft robotic whisker sensor array's behavior in controlled conditions
- *Key Deliverables*:
    - Refurbished ROV platform
    - Custom-designed seal head and whisker mounts
    - Test whisker arrays embedded with sensors
    - 3D pose tracking software library
<br>

## **ROV Hardware and Electronics Maintenance**
Tasks Completed: 
- Fixing frame and replacing damaged components
- Upgrading motors and ESCs

Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented:
- Single motor drawing less voltage than other motors
    - Removed motor and found exposed wires that had rusted
    - Replaced with new motor
- Water leaking into electronics chamber
    - Replaced cable valves and sealed with marine sealant
